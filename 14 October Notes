Questions and Points of Interest (Discussion with Chad)

1. Ratio comparison, normal distribution assumes negative infinity to infinity. Ratios are 0 to infinityàlog transform to make neg infinity to infinity.
2. Distribution assessment, bounds, discrete. Some distributions have similar types
3. Whether or not to log transform data then statistics, or statistics first?
4. Student-t test compare 2 numbers, anova for multiple
5. Tukey HSD vs. LSD
6. Sample size limits on p-value significance, is it ok to increase sample size to make p-value significant?
7. CO2 fixation and CO2 concentration, photosynthesis plots use glmm (generalized linear mixed model) to plot each genotype and analyze the differences.
8. Multiple experiments: Non-independence factors
9. Non-linear mixed models…when use them, why…?
